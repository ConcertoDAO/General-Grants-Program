# Concerto DAO

## Project Description

### Abstrict

Concerto, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), works on top of Poladot, Bulletproof, and Game Theory. It is not only a trendy technology of Utopia but is also tailored for the real world. Furthermore, a series of problems related to profitability, decentralization and secrecy that lead to the failure of other DAOs can be solved here. Based on three core principles: profit first, decentralization, and secrecy, Concerto can successfully strip information asymmetry off individual investment behaviour with the help of game theory and zero-knowledge technology. Owing to the secret and verifiable information on Concerto, investors might gain profit easier than in other classic DAOs with traditional methods.

Concerto DAO will run on Polkadot. The reason for this choice is to widen the range within which the investment can be targeted. Thanks to cross-chain technology, Concerto can theoretically touch any crypto assets in the blockchain world, and makes it possible to directly perform on-chain asset management.

## Legal Structure
Please provide the name and registered address of the legal entity executing the project. These details can also be shared privately via the Google Form used for your application.

## Team's experience
Please describe the team's relevant experience.  If the project involves development work, then we'd appreciated if you can single out a few interesting code commits made by team members on their past projects.  We'll glance at whole repositories too, but not if they contain many vendored dependencies, which often makes commits easier.

## Development Roadmap
This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to have as much detail as possible. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Here is a reminder of the main criteria of our grants:
* Focus on Substrate / Polkadot related projects.
* Max $100k.
* Timeframe: up to 3 months is ideal.
* Open source license (the preferred license is Apache 2.0)

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions it should be clear how the project is related to Substrate and/or Polkadot. We recommend that the scope of the work can fit within a 3 month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 month = 1 milestone. It is always best to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product.

For each milestone:
* Please be sure to include a specification of the software. The level of detail must be enough so that we are able to test that the software meets the specification.
* Please include total amount of funding requested per milestone. Funding can be in fiat (CHF, EUR or USD) or in DOTs. It can also be in a combination of fiat and DOTs. Please reach out to grants@web3.foundation to discuss what amount in fiat and DOTs would be appropriate for your project.
* Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* Please commit to providing a docker container for the delivery of your project.
* Please indicate the number of Full-Time Employees working on each milestone, and include the number of days along with their cost per day.

### Milestone 1 — Implement Substrate Modules — 1 month — $10,000

* ZKP implementation in Rust with basic Pederson Commitment and Crypto Toolsets it's `ink!` contract API (Apache 2.0 license).
* Testable economic model, Data back testing for our Whitepaper (in Python).
* Vault Contract based on `ink!` DSL for ZKP based Concerto Token Distribution Phase.
* The code will have proper unit-test coverage to ensure functionality and robustness.
* We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial describing how the software can be used and tested.

### Milestone 2 — Additional features — 1 month — $10,000
* Implement Bulletproof NIZK based on out ZKP system.
* Voting / Proposal Smart contracts which are based on Range Proof.
* We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial describing how the software can be used and tested.

### Milestone 3 — Additional features — 1 month — $10,000
* Full feature version of Concerto DAO, including Vault, Voting, Proposal and Liquidation Smart Contract.
* Formal verification for Contracts (with Coq).

## Future Plans
* Please include the team's long-term plans and intentions.
